<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts and lived there the majority of my life until. A couple of months ago I moved to Austin, Texas with my lovely wife, Lisa. </p>
<p> I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice from Northeastern University. I loved watching crime shows and I had an interest in being a Crime Scene Investigator. But after doing poorly in chemistry and struggling to find another path that was right for me, I decided to leave criminal justice behind.</p>
<p> After making the decision to pursue another career path, I decided to explore another interest of mine, technology. I went from wanting to be a cyber security analyst, to a computer technician, to a sales person. None of them felt right for me. Then I decided to give web development </p>
